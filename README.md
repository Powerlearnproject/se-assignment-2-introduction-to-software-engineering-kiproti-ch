Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It is a systematic and disciplined approach to software development that aims to create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
This refers to the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It is a systematic and disciplined approach to software development that aims to create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software
Software Engineering differs from traditional programming in that, the two IT professionals lies in the responsibilities and approach to the work. Namely, software engineers use well-defined scientific principles and procedures to deliver an efficient and reliable software product.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): refers to the process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time possible. SDLC provides a well-structured flow of phases that help an organization to quickly produce high-quality software which is well-tested and ready for production use.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Stage 1: Planning and Requirement Analysis
Requirement analysis is the most important and fundamental stage in SDLC. It is performed by the senior members of the team with inputs from the customer, the sales department, market surveys and domain experts in the industry.
Stage 2: Defining Requirements
Once the requirement analysis is done the next step is to clearly define and document the product requirements and get them approved from the customer or the market analysts.
Stage 3: Designing the Product Architecture
SRS is the reference for product architects to come out with the best architecture for the product to be developed.
Stage 4: Building or Developing the Product
In this stage of SDLC the actual development starts and the product is built. The programming code is generated as per DDS during this stage.
Stage 5: Testing the Product
This stage is usually a subset of all the stages as in the modern SDLC models, the testing activities are mostly involved in all the stages of SDLC
Stage 6: Deployment in the Market and Maintenance
Once the product is tested and ready to be deployed it is released formally in the appropriate market.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile model is a combination of iterative and incremental models, that is, it is made up of iterative and incremental models while Waterfall model is a linear and sequential model, which means that a development phase cannot begin until the previous phase is completed.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Waterfall methodology is a step-by-step approach to software development that focuses on sequentially progressing through each stage and phase of the development process while Agile methodology is a way of managing projects that focuses on delivering quick results, being able to handle changing requirements and emphasizing teamwork.
Scenarios where waterfall model might be preferred: Software engineering and product development, less often – in other projects and industries.
Scenario where Agile model might be preferred: Construction projects often include various steps until completion. Applying the Agile philosophy helps such companies achieve operational transparency, improve resource utilization, and communication.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering?
Refers to a systematic and strict approach to the definition, creation, and verification of requirements for a software system is known as requirements engineering.

Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
1. Feasibility Study: Mainly concentrates on Technical feasibility, Operational Feasibility and Economic Feasibility
2. Requirements Elicitation: It is related to the various ways used to gain knowledge about the project domain and requirements.
3. Requirements Specification: This activity is used to produce formal software requirement models. All the requirements including the functional as well as the non-functional requirements and the constraints are specified by these models in totality.
4. Requirements Verification and Validation: Verification: It refers to the set of tasks that ensures that the software correctly implements a specific function while validation: It refers to a different set of tasks that ensures that the software that has been built is traceable to customer requirements.
5. Requirements Management: 

Software Design Principles:
Should not suffer from "Tunnel Vision"
Traceable to analysis model
Should not "Reinvent The Wheel"
Minimize Intellectual distance
Exhibit uniformity and interogation

Explain the concept of modularity in software design.
Modularity in software engineering refers to the design approach that emphasises the separation of concerns, where a complex software system is divided into smaller, loosely coupled modules.

How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modular software architecture breaks down complex systems into smaller, manageable modules or components. These modules function independently while also collaborating seamlessly within the larger software system.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Testing is the process of executing a program to find errors. To make our software perform well it should be error-free. If testing is done successfully it will remove all the errors from the software.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing).
Unit/Component Testing
Unit testing is done at the code level, where each component is tested individually to ensure their impartiality and analyze their functionality.
Integration testing
Enables software testers to test group units integrated into a system or subsystems; it helps identify any bugs or issues arising from coding errors or integrations between modules.
System testing
Performed on an integrated environment comprising the whole application, where all components are assessed against specific business requirements.
Acceptance testing
Involves testing the system’s Functional and Non-functional aspects, such as performance, security, usability, accessibility, compatibility, and reliability. 

Why is testing crucial in software development?
Helps in saving money
Security
Product Quality
Satisfaction of the customer
Determining the performance of the software

Version Control Systems:
Refers to the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. 

What are version control system
and why are they important in software development? 
Facilitates collaborative coding
Tracks changes to codebase
Enhances code organization
Enables seamless team collaboration
Improves code quality and productivity

Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
GitHub
GitHub helps software teams to collaborate and maintain the entire history of code changes. You can track changes in code, turn back the clock to undo errors and share your efforts with other team members.
GitLab
GitLab comes with a lot of handy features like an integrated project, a project website, etc. Using the continuous integration (CI) capabilities of GitLab, you can automatically test and deliver the code.
Beanstalk
Beanstalk is an ideal option for those who need to work from remote places. This software is based on browser and cloud, allowing users to code, commit, review and deploy using a browser.
erForce
Perforce delivers the version control capabilities through its HelixCore. The HelixCore comes with a single platform for seamless team collaboration, and support for both centralized and distributed development workflows.

Software Project Management:
This refers to the proper way of planning and leading software projects. It is a part of project management in which software projects are planned, implemented, monitored, and controlled. 

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Responsibilities:
Project Estimation
Project Size Estimation is the most significant parameter based on which all other estimations like cost, duration and effort are made. Cost Estimation, Time Estimation and Effort Estimation
Scheduling
After the completion of the estimation of all the project parameters, scheduling for manpower and other resources is done.
Staffing
Team structure and staffing plans are made.
Risk Management
The project manager should identify the unanticipated risks that may occur during project development risk, analyze the damage that might cause these risks, and take a risk reduction plan to cope with these risks.
Challenges:
Misalignment between goals and business objectives 
Communication 
Lack of accountability 
Resource allocation 
Scope creep
Project management software
Poor planning and unrealistic deadlines 

Software Maintenance:
Software Maintenance refers to the process of modifying and updating a software system after it has been delivered to the customer. It is a critical part of the software development life cycle (SDLC) and is necessary to ensure that the software continues to meet the needs of the users over time.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities.
Preventive Maintenance:  includes regular and periodic (time-based) schedules.
Corrective Maintenance: occurs when an issue is noticed.
Predetermined maintenance: follows a factory schedule.
Condition-based maintenance: occurs when a situation or condition indicates maintenance is needed.
Predictive maintenance: is data-driven and impacted by preset parameters.
Reactive maintenance – occurs when a total breakdown or failure appears.

Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Increased data security
Improved performance and efficiency
Seamless project continuity
Lower long-term total cost of ownership
